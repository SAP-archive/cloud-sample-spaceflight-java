## Exercises

We longer support the initial 'space travel' application in this repository. 

If you’re interested in building business applications using the CAP Java SDK, we recommend the [CAP Samples for Java](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples-java). The application in this project enables browsing books, managing books, and managing orders. The following features will be demonstrated:
   - Framework and Infrastructure-related Features
   - Domain Model related Features
   - Service Model related Features
   - User Interface related Features
