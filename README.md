# Important Notice
We longer maintain the 'space travel' application in this repository.

The application in this project enables browsing books, managing books, and managing orders. The following features will be demonstrated:
   - Framework and Infrastructure-related Features
   - Domain Model related Features
   - Service Model related Features
   - User Interface related Features
